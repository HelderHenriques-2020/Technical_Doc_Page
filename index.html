                    There are a number of guides within MDN docs. These articles aim to add additional usage examples, 
                    or teach you how to use an API or feature. This page links to some of the most popular material.

                    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. 
                    For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, 
                    or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, 
                    this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.

                <p> As principais partes do nosso elemento são as seguintes:</p>

                    <li>
                        A tag de abertura: Consiste no nome do elemento (neste caso, p), 
                        envolto em colchetes angulares de abertura e fechamento. 
                        Isso indica onde o elemento começa ou começa a ter efeito - neste caso, 
                        onde o parágrafo começa
                    </li>
                    <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                    <li>
                        The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. 
                        This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. 
                        Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
                    </li>
                    <li>The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
                    <li>The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>

                    Cascading Stylesheets — or CSS — is the first technology you should start learning after HTML. 
                    While HTML is used to define the structure and semantics of your content, 
                    CSS is used to style it and lay it out. For example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, 
                    and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.

                JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages. 
                Every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information 
                for you to look at—displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, 
                scrolling video jukeboxes, or more—you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.

                Python is a high level general-purpose programming language. It uses a multi-paradigm approach, 
                meaning it supports procedural, object-oriented, and some functional programming constructs.
                It was created by Guido van Rossum as a successor to another language (called ABC) between 1985 and 1990, 
                and is currently used on a large array of domains like web development, desktop applications, data science,
                DevOps, and automation/productivity.

                Ruby is an open-source programming language. In a Web context, Ruby is often used server-side with the Ruby 
                On Rails (ROR) framework to produce websites/apps.
                Ruby is also a method for annotating east Asian text in HTML documents to provide pronunciation information
            </p>
            <code>
                <rb>This is a long text to check</rb>
                <rp>（</rp><rt>short ruby</rt><rp>）</rp>
            </code>
            <p>
                Ruby is object-oriented: every value is an object, including classes and instances of types 
                that many other languages designate as primitives (such as integers, booleans, and "null"). 
                Variables always hold references to objects. Every function is a method and methods are always called on an object. 
                Methods defined at the top level scope become methods of the Object class. 
                Since this class is an ancestor of every other class, such methods can be called on any object. 
                They are also visible in all scopes, effectively serving as "global" procedures. 
                Ruby supports inheritance with dynamic dispatch, mixins and singleton methods (belonging to, and defined for, 
                a single instance rather than being defined on the class). Though Ruby does not support multiple inheritance, 
                classes can import modules as mixins.
                Ruby has been described as a multi-paradigm programming language: it allows procedural 
                programming (defining functions/variables outside classes makes them part of the root, 'self' Object), 
                with object orientation (everything is an object) or functional programming (it has anonymous functions, 
                closures, and continuations; statements all have values, and functions return the last evaluation). 
                It has support for introspection, reflection and metaprogramming, as well as support for interpreter-based threads. 
                Ruby features dynamic typing, and supports parametric polymorphism.
            </p>
            <p>
                The syntax of Ruby is broadly similar to that of Perl and Python. Class and method definitions are signaled by keywords, 
                whereas code blocks can be defined by either keywords or braces. In contrast to Perl, 
                variables are not obligatorily prefixed with a sigil. When used, the sigil changes the semantics of scope of the variable. 
                For practical purposes there is no distinction between expressions and statements.
